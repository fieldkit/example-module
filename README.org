* Overview

  Dummy project for developing the FK core firmware and module libraries.

* C++ vs C

  Right now this project is primarily C in C++ files. It will probably be slowly
  migrated to C++17 though once things have stabilized and there's time for me
  to re-familiarze myself with the modern landscape of C++.
